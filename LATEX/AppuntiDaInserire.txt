Una probabile introduzione: A deepfake is a digital photo, video or sound file of a real person that has been edited to create an extremely realistic but false depiction of them doing or saying something that they did not actually do or say.It is related not just of humans but also of animals, machines and even inanimate objects.

Unico ostacolo facilmente aggirabile: To generate convincing content, most current deepfake technologies require large amounts of genuine data 

Photo deepfake , entertainment, education, medicine and other fields, particularly for modelling and predicting behaviour

Video deepfakes: The most common methods for creating deepfakes involvs autoencoders that employ a face-swapping technique. You first need a target video to use as the basis of the deepfake and then a collection of video clips of the person you want to insert in the target. 

The videos can be completely unrelated; the target might be a clip from a Hollywood movie, for example, and the videos of the person you want to insert in the film might be random clips downloaded from YouTube


GNAs: which detects and improves any flaws in the deepfake within multiple rounds, making it harder for deepfake detectors to decode them. Indeed, the field is evolving so rapidly that deepfake content can be generated without the need for any human supervision at all, using what is called recycled generative adversarial networks (commonly referred to as GANs).


audio deepfake: Realistic audio deepfakes can now be made using deep learning algorithms with just a few hours (or in some cases, minutes) of audio of the person whose voice is being cloned, and once a model of a voice is made, that person can be made to say anything, such as when fake audio of a CEO was used to commit fraud last year. 


Social problems: and the since removed DeepNude, a particularly dangerous app that generated fake nude images of women. One of the first real-world applications for deepfakes was, in fact, to create synthetic pornography.  In 2017, a reddit user named "deepfakes'' created a forum for porn that featured face-swapped actors.According to a Deeptrace report, pornography made up 96% of deepfake videos found online in 2019. Deepfake video has also been used in politics. In 2018, for example, a Belgian political party released a video of Donald Trump giving a speech calling on Belgium to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.

CONCLUSIONE
Problem interconneted to the future: Many experts believe that, in the future, deepfakes will become far more sophisticated as technology further develops and might introduce more serious threats to the public, relating to election interference, political tension, and additional criminal activity.(Aggiungi esempi)

How can we detect a deepfake?
Current deepfakes have trouble realistically animating faces, and the result is video in which the subject never blinks, or blinks far too often or unnaturally. However, after researchers at University of Albany published a study detecting the blinking abnormality, new deepfakes were released that no longer had this problem. 
Look for problems with skin or hair, or faces that seem to be blurrier than the environment in which they're positioned. The focus might look unnaturally soft. 
Does the lighting look unnatural? Often, deepfake algorithms will retain the lighting of the clips that were used as models for the fake video, which is a poor match for the lighting in the target video. 

Probelma MOOLTO ATTUALE(molte aziende si stanno interessando):
Sensity, for example, has developed a detection platform that's akin to an antivirus for deepfakes that alerts users via email when they're watching something that bears telltale fingerprints of AI-generated synthetic media. Sensity uses the same deep learning processes used to create fake videos. 

Operation Minerva takes a more straightforward approach to detecting deepfakes. This company's algorithm compares potential deepfakes to known video that has already been "digitally fingerprinted." For example, it can detect examples of revenge porn by recognizing that the deepfake video is simply a modified version of an existing video that Operation Minerva has already catalogued.

Facebook hosted the Deepfake Detection Challenge, an open, collaborative initiative to encourage the creation of new technologies for detecting deepfakes and other kinds of manipulated media. The competition featured prizes ranging up to $500,000.
